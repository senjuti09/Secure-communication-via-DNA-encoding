# Secure-communication-via-DNA-encoding
Secure data communication is the most important and essential issue in
message transmission over the networks. Cryptography provides a way of
making secure messages for confidential message transfer. Cryptography
is the process of transforming the sender's message to a secret format
called cipher text that only the intended receiver will understand the
meaning of the secret message.
Various cryptographic or DNA based encoding algorithms have been
proposedin order to make secret messages for communication. But all
these proposed DNA based encryption algorithms are not secure enough
to provide better security as compared with today's security requirement.
In this paper, we have proposed a technique of encryption that will
enhance the message security. In this proposed algorithm, a new method
of DNA based encryption with a strong key of 256 bit is used.
Along with this big size key various other encoding tools are used
as key inthe encoding process of the message like random series of DNA
(Deoxyribonucleic Acid) bases, modified DNA bases coding. Moreover,
a new method of round key selection is also given in this paper to provide
better security in the message. The cipher text contains the extra bit of
information like the DNA strands that willprovide better and enhanced
security against intruder's attack.
This paper explores the novel concept of secure communication
through DNA encoding, leveraging the distinctive properties of
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) for information storage and transmission.
The method involves encoding messages into DNA sequences, utilizing
its vast storage capacity and potential for biometric authentication based
on individual genetic codes. We delve into the biochemical operations,
such as DNA synthesis and sequencing, required for implementing this
approach. While facing challenges such as time-consuming processes and
associated costs, the potential benefits in terms of security and information
density make DNA-based communication an intriguing avenue for
exploration. Ongoing research and development in this field aim to assess
the practicality and viability of employing DNA encoding for secure
communication in real-world applications.
